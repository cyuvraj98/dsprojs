‚Ä¢ Project name: Social Justice During the COVID-19 Pandemic


[![Youtube Video Demonstration(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkdEMrCjJpE&feature=youtu.be
 "Hackathon Video")


‚Ä¢ Description: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are all concerned about public health and safety, but social justice is crucial and should not be forgotten. From the past up till now, people in the United States have been treated unequally. With these two situations in mind, this project prepares the data from the Twitter social media site using hashtags and user locations to trace where demonstrations occur as well as the data from the Kaggle website (primary source: The New York Times) to check which location has a high number of corona virus cases. You can make API requests and create data visualizations by using these datasets.
	
‚Ä¢Installation: No need to install, what you need to do is to apply for a developer account in Twitter (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs...). If you want, you can install JupyterLab in your local computer. Alternatively, you can run JupyterLab online.  https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/jupyterlab-jupyterlab-demo-2d0hqm4r/lab  


‚Ä¢	Usage: Importing all necessary libraries

```ruby
	import http.client 
	import mimetypes
	import json
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	import numpy as np
	from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS 
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
	import pandas as pd 
	import mimetypes

```

HTTP GET request to connect to the Twitter API and get response data in JSON format. Replace #add bearer key with your bearer token and # add personalization to your personalization id


```ruby
conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.twitter.com")
payload = ''
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer', #add bearer key
  'Cookie': 'personalization_id="'# add personalization
}
conn.request("GET", "/1.1/search/tweets.json?q=BlackLivesMatter%20since:2020-05-20&lang=en&%23protestl&result_type=recent", payload, headers)
res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()
#print(data.decode("utf-8"))

unstructured_tweets = json.loads(data)
indent_tweets = json.dumps(json.loads(data), indent=2)
#print(indent_tweets)
#print(unstructured_tweets)
data = json.loads(indent_tweets)

with open('tweets.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

text = ''
with open("game.txt", "w", encoding='utf-8') as text_file:
    for status in data['statuses']:
        text += status['text']
        text += ' '
        print(status['text'])
        text_file.write(status['text'])
```

We will get rid of bad characters - this part can be customized to your preference.

```ruby
	comment_words = ''
	stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)
	bad_chars = [';', ':', '!', "*"] 
	for val in text.split(' '):
	    val = str(val)
	    for i in bad_chars : 
	        val = val.replace(i, '')
	    tokens = val.split()
	    for i in range(len(tokens)):
	        tokens[i] = tokens[i].lower()
	    if len(val)> 4:
	        comment_words += " ".join(tokens) + " "
	wordcloud = WordCloud().generate(comment_words)
	print(comment_words)

```
We get this output after running the above code.

After mining the data from the Twitter API, you can use the obtained data in your project. In this example, we make a Word Cloud depicting the sentiments of the general populace on Twitter regarding the Black Lives Matter movement. 

```ruby
	wordcloud = WordCloud(width = 800, height = 800, 
        	background_color ='white', 
		stopwords = stopwords, 
		min_font_size = 10).generate(comment_words) 
	plt.figure(figsize = (8, 8), facecolor = None) 
	plt.imshow(wordcloud) 
	plt.axis("off") 
        plt.tight_layout(pad = 0) 

	plt.show()

```

We use another dataset to analyze COVID-19 cases. We import all the libraries we need and obtain the live dataset from Kaggle.com (primary source: New York Times). Select a portion of the data you want to work with - in this case we want data from three days back from the present date.

```ruby
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import plotly
import matplotlib as plt
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.offline as pyo
from datetime import date, timedelta
import folium
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
pyo.init_notebook_mode()

covid = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv", error_bad_lines = False)

today = date.today()
three_days_back = (today - timedelta(days=3)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
covid_latest = covid[covid.date.eq(three_days_back)]
covid_states_lst = np.array([ 'Alabama', 'Alaska', 'Arizona', 'Arkansas', 'California', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut', 'Delaware', 'District of Columbia', 'Florida', 'Georgia', 'Guam', 'Hawaii', 'Idaho', 'Illinois', 'Indiana', 'Iowa', 'Kansas', 'Kentucky', 'Louisiana', 'Maine', 'Maryland', 'Massachusetts', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Mississippi', 'Missouri', 'Montana', 'Nebraska', 'Nevada', 'New Hampshire', 'New Jersey', 'New Mexico', 'New York', 'North Carolina', 'North Dakota', 'Northern Mariana Islands', 'Ohio', 'Oklahoma', 'Oregon', 'Pennsylvania', 'Puerto Rico', 'Rhode Island', 'South Carolina', 'South Dakota', 'Tennessee', 'Texas', 'Utah', 'Vermont', 'Virgin Islands', 'Virginia', 'Washington', 'West Virginia', 'Wisconsin', 'Wyoming']) 
covid_state_total = covid_latest.groupby('state', as_index = False).sum()
print(covid_state_total)

```

We will get data of COVID-19 cases in each state in the US

```ruby
                       state   cases  deaths

Now we are going to make a data visualization and we will use it for the application 

```ruby
fig = go.Figure(data=[
go.Bar(name='Cases', x=covid_state_total['state'], y= covid_state_total['cases']),
go.Bar(name='Deaths', x=covid_state_total['state'], y= covid_state_total['deaths'])
]
)
fig.update_layout(title="COVID-19 Cases in the United States as of " + three_days_back, barmode='group')
fig.show()

```

// picture of the output
```ruby
fig = px.sunburst(covid_latest, path=['state','county'], values = 'cases')
fig.update_layout(title = "COVID-19 Cases by State, County as of " + three_days_back)
fig.show()

```
// picture of the output

For the visualizations, please refer to COVID-19.ipynb (https://github.com/18Badenm/UCBerkleyHackathon/blob/master/COVID-19.ipynb)!

This is an example of the implementation done from the **New York Times** 'live' COVID-19 dataset
